## Usage

This code is still in a pretty rough state but I've uploaded it here for those interested.  
There is a demo package included in the demo folder. After importing this as a package just double click it to import.  
  
The demo requires that you import Shader Graph and the Universal Render Pipeline packages from the package manager.  
Ensure both 'depth texture' and 'opaque texture' options are enabled on your renderer asset or set unity to use the included render assets.
The demo may require 2019.3
