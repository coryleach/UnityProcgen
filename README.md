## Usage

Provides Value, Perlin and Simplex noise functions that are seeded and random-access.
Perlin and Simplex noise methods are based on the [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/simplex-noise/) tutorial but are implemented using Squirrel Eiserloh's noise algorithm rather than the hash method used in the tutorial. This provides the ability to Seed all the noise functions.
  
There is a demo package included in the demo folder. After importing this as a package just double click it to import.  
  
The demo requires that you import Shader Graph and the Universal Render Pipeline packages from the package manager.  
Ensure both 'depth texture' and 'opaque texture' options are enabled on your renderer asset or set unity to use the included render assets.
The demo may require 2019.3
